## Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Criteria

Given that a user needs a new, secure password, there should be a prompt to ask for password criteria, then a password is generated.
